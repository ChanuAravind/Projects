Problem Statement

Scaler is an online tech-versity offering intensive computer science & Data Science courses through live classes delivered by tech leaders and subject matter experts. The meticulously structured program enhances the skills of software professionals by offering a modern curriculum with exposure to the latest technologies. It is a product by InterviewBit.

You are working as a data scientist with the analytics vertical of Scaler, focused on profiling the best companies and job positions to work for from the Scaler database. You are provided with the information for a segment of learners and tasked to cluster them on the basis of their job profile, company, and other features. Ideally, these clusters should have similar characteristics.

Dataset:

Dataset Link: https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/856/original/scaler_clustering.csv

Data Dictionary:

‘Unnamed 0’- Index of the dataset
Email_hash- Anonymised Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
Company_hash- Current employer of the learner
orgyear- Employment start date
CTC- Current CTC
Job_position- Job profile in the company
CTC_updated_year: Year in which CTC got updated (Yearly increments, Promotions)
Concept Used:

Manual Clustering
Unsupervised Clustering - K- means, Hierarchical Clustering

Outline:

Import the dataset and do usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
Checking unique emails and frequency of occurrence of the same email hash in the data. Recording observation and inference, wherever necessary.
Checking for missing values and Prepare data for KNN/ Mean Imputation.
You may have to remove special characters from the dataset by using Regex
Don’t worry if you haven’t used that before. The syntax is quite simple and intuitive
Code:
mystring='\tAirtel X Labs'
re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', '', mystring)
Checking for duplicates in the dataset and drop them
Making some new features like adding ‘Years of Experience’ column by subtracting orgyear from current year
Manual Clustering on the basis of learner’s company, job position and years of experience
Getting the 5 point summary of CTC (mean, median, max, min, count etc) on the basis of Company, Job Position, Years of Experience
Merging the same with original dataset carefully and creating some flags showing learners with CTC greater than the Average of their Company’s department having same Years of Experience - Call that flag designation with values [1,2,3]
Doing above analysis at Company & Job Position level. Name that flag Class with values [1,2,3]
Repeating the same analysis at the Company level. Name that flag Tier with values [1,2,3]
Based on the manual clustering done so far, answering few questions like:
Top 10 employees (earning more than most of the employees in the company) - Tier 1
Top 10 employees of data science in Amazon / TCS etc earning more than their peers - Class 1
Bottom 10 employees of data science in Amazon / TCS etc earning less than their peers - Class 3
Bottom 10 employees (earning less than most of the employees in the company)- Tier 3
Top 10 employees in Amazon- X department - having 5/6/7 years of experience earning more than their peers - Tier X
Top 10 companies (based on their CTC)
Top 2 positions in every company (based on their CTC)
Data processing for Unsupervised clustering - Label encoding/ One- hot encoding, Standardization of data
Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
Checking clustering tendency
Elbow method
K-means clustering
Hierarchical clustering (you can do this on a sample of the dataset if your process is taking time)
Insights from Unsupervised Clustering
Provide actionable Insights & Recommendations for the Business.
